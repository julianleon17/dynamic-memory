# Dynamic Memory

Exercises about dynamic memory to understand how work :D

- In this branch the projects handle the windows command "cls"
- It can be compiled and run in "cmd", or at least i do it in "cmd"

Use the command to compile :
> gcc -o file.out file.c

Use the command to run :
> file.out


## Folder "dynamic-memory"
The first folder is a program to enter data from many people and display the information

- I don't continue beacuse i still don't know how to call functions in another functions recursively, i even tried using "goto" but it's not worked ( "goto" just work locally, that is, in a single function )


## Folder "linked-list"
Program that collects numbers and lists them in a linked way, delves deeper into what a "node" is

- I improved the code a bit
